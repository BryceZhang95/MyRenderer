# MyRenderer
Rasterization based graphic renderer

### System Review
- Implement a C++ system to read in geometric data of a polygonal object and to display the object using scan conversion. Hidden surfaces are removed with Z-Buffer algorithm.
- Shading algorithms (constant, Gouraud, and Phong) and Phong illumination model are implemented with texture mapped.
- No API is used(start from scratch). Opengl is only used to draw points on the screen.

### Environment
- MacOS X + Xcode
- C++
